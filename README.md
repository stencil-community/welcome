# Welcome!

The Stencil Community GitHub org seeks to bring together the highest quality Stencil packages and the Stencil package authoring community into a single place and help users find high quality, well maintained Stencil packages.

Each package in this org commits to a base level of maintenance and quality control, and, as much as possible, follows a set of consistent design and code standards.

Unlike Stencil itself, the Stencil Community plugins are not primarily maintained by the Stencil core team but by the community and community maintainers. The Stencil team does, however, facilitate and work closely with maintainers to ensure that packages are kept up to date, follow the latest in Stencil packages standards, and have a broad set of useful functionality.

Beyond maintenance, authors commit to providing a safe environment and adhere to the community [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stencil-community/welcome/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and expect the same of all users.
